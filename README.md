**Welcome to Team 16's project: OnlyFoods**

OnlyFood is a meal-planning app that aims to aid users in minimizing food waste. It tracks the contents of a user's fridge and suggests recipes using a heuristic algorithm that prioritizes certain factors, such as whether a recipe utilizes ingredients close to expiry, or if the user can make easy substitutions. OnlyFood aims to maximize user retention by establishing a social-media-like platform
