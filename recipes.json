        "description": "It was almost like Chekhov's bull penis in its inevitability. I'd spotted the foam trays of \"pizzle\" in the offal section of Fei Long, my favorite pan-Asian market, and done the inevitable snickering and Tweeting, but I knew somewhere deep within that it was only a matter of time before I took the bull by the horns and figured out a way to stick it in the Instant Pot. Most penis-based recipes make no bones about the fact that it takes an awfully long time to cook down, but when you apply the right kind of pressure, it all comes together pretty quickly. \n Recipe taken from: https://myrecipes.com",
